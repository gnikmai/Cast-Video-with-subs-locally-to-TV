# Cast-Video-with-subs-locally-to-TV
This is just a simple HTML5 video player where you can upload your MP4/WEBM and VTT subtitle files locally from your PC. Then, you can use the Chromecast built-in feature from Chrome or Edge to cast it on a bigger screen like a TV.
<ul>
        <span style="font-size: 1.2em;">
          <li>Make sure that your TV/device and PC are connected to the same Wi-Fi network</li>
          <br>
          <li>Chrome/Edge setting (the three dots)</li>
          <br>
          <li>More tools > Cast media to device</li>
          <br>
          <li>Choose the TV/device to cast to</li>
          <br>
          <li>Select Sources > Cast tab</li>
          <br>
          <li>Enable fullscreen mode on the video player</li>
          <br>
          <li>Now you can watch movies with subtitles on the big screen without a Chromecast device or USB</li>

      </ul>
